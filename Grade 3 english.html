<p>One day, Ann and Frank went to the lake with their dog <br>
  Rover. Rover can swim well, so Frank threw a stick into the<br>
  water for him to fetch.<br>
  “Jump, Rover! Jump in and get the stick,” said Frank, and<br>
  into the water Rover went with a big splash. Pretty soon he<br>
  came out with the stick in his mouth.<br>
  Rover did not like the game as much as Frank because the<br>
  water was a little cold.<br>
  They had fun for a while with Rover, and then set out for<br>
  home because it was late in the day, and they could not<br>
  stay long.<br>
  On the way home, Rover saw a rabbit and away he went<br>
  after it as fast as he could go. Ann and Frank ran too but<br>
  could not keep up with Rover and the rabbit.<br>
  When they got home, Rover was there, and Frank said,<br>
  “Where is the rabbit, Rover?” Rover gave Frank a funny look<br>
  and laid down on his mat.<br>
  “Oh I know,” said Frank. “The rabbit ran so fast you could<br>
  not catch it.<br>

    Six blind men who stood by the roadside every day and<br>
asked for money from the people who passed. They had<br>
often heard of elephants, but they had never seen one.<br>
How could they? They were blind.<br>
It so happened one morning that an elephant was driven<br>
down the road where they stood. When they were told that<br>
the great beast was before them, they asked the driver to<br>
let him stop so that they might see him.<br>
Of course they could not see him with their eyes, but they<br>
thought that by touching him they could learn<br>
just what kind of animal he was.<br>
The first one happened to put his hand on the<br>
elephant's side. “Well, well!” he said, “Now I<br>
know all about this beast. He is exactly like a wall.”<br>
The second felt only of the elephant's tusk. “My brother,” he<br>
said, “You are mistaken. He is not at all like a wall. He is<br>
round and smooth and sharp. He is more l ike a spear than<br>
anything else.”<br>

The third happened to take<br>
hold of the elephant's trunk.<br>
“Both of you are wrong,” he said.<br>
“Anybody who knows anything can see that this elephant is like a snake.”<br>
The fourth reached out his arms and<br>
grasped one of the elephant's legs.<br>
“Oh, how blind you are,” he said. “It is<br>
very plain to me that he is round and tall like a tree.”<br>
The fifth was a very tall man, and he chanced to take hold<br>
of the elephant's ear. “The blindest man ought to know that<br>
this beast is not like any of the things that you name,” he<br>
said. “He is exactly like a huge fan.”<br>
It took the sixth blind man some time before he could find<br>
the elephant at all. At last he seized the animal's tail. “Oh<br>
foolish fellows,” he cried, “you surely have lost your senses.<br>
This elephant is not like a wall or a spear or a snake or a<br>
tree, nor is he like a fan. But any man with any sense can<br>
see that he is exactly like a rope.”<br>
Then the elephant moved on, and the six blind men sat by<br>
the roadside all day and quarreled about him. Each<br>
believed that he knew just how the animal looked, and<br>
each called the others unkind names because they did not<br>
agree with each other.<br>
People who have eyes sometimes act as foolishly.
